# Hello, I'm Ashley!

Coding is my passion. I'm into game development and game security, mostly interested in anti-cheats, Roblox and Unity.

I've been a Roblox developer and Roblox game security for 6 years. I'm a novice in Unity.

Check out my projects if you want to hire me! I only accept commissions.
