# Hello, I'm Ashley!

Coding is my passion. **Game development and game security** are the areas of focus, with an interest primarily held in anti-cheats, Roblox, and Unity.

For six years, I have worked as both a Roblox developer and a Roblox game security specialist. Currently, I am learning how to use Unity for game development.

I always write code with **security and performance** in mind. I try to learn everything I can about the tools I use to maximize performance and patch all vulnerabilities.

I'm interested in **ECS** and I almost always use it in my projects.

**If you're interested in hiring me, please check out my repositories. I only take commissions.**
