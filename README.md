# Hello, I'm Ashley!

Coding is my passion. I'm into game development and game security, mostly interested in anti-cheats, Roblox and Unity.

I've been a Roblox developer and Roblox game security for 6 years. I'm new to Unity.

I always write code with security and performance in mind. I always try to research what I'm using to squeeze out every drop of performance and patch every vulnerability.

I'm interested in ECS and almost always use it in my projects.

Check out my projects if you want to hire me! I only accept commissions.
